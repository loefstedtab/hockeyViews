# An in-progress personal project to attempt to recreate some of my favorite hockey-data websites.

1) I want to learn how to work with very large data sets, which I downloaded from MoneyPuck.com
2) I want to practice styling as it is something that I am not very good at.

I am using Victory Charts to create all of the graphics in the website. This is also an opportunity for me to try and work with RTK Query for the first time beyond the walk-through provided in their documentation.

There is a fair amount of un-used code in here that I plan on referencing as I work through the project.
