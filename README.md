# An in-progress personal project to attempt to recreate some of my favorite hockey-data websites.

1) I want to learn how to work with very large data sets, which I downloaded from MoneyPuck.com
2) I really enjoy data visualizations that are somehow able to show a lot of data while being minimalist in their presentation, like hockey-viz. I will be trying to emulate that kind of style for my charts.
3) I want to practice CSS styling as it is something that I am not very good at and I want to try and recreate some effects that I have seen online.

I am using Victory Charts to create all of the graphics in the website. This is also an opportunity for me to try and work with RTK Query for the first time beyond the walk-through provided in their documentation.

There is a fair amount of un-used code in here that I plan on referencing as I work through the project.
